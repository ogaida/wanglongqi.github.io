These two days, several improvements have been made to `WriteTeX`. The main flaws in the code are fixed. The version is too small to reflect the progress of the project. Therefore, I decided to release the extension at a version number of v0.4. Main changes of this release are

- Preamble can be type directly into the preamble box.
- Error handling for latex compilation errors.
- Documents updates.

As is noted in the commit message, maybe `pdfcrop` will be added to the dependency list. If the scale problem is solved, the extension will be very close to finally release.
